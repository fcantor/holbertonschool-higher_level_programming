# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

The purpose of this project is to learn the following concepts:

- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

## Requirements for Python scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 1.3.x
- Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.2.x
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')```
- All your classes should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')```
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')```
- You are not allowed to use ```execute``` with sqlalchemy
